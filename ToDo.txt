Generalized and Expanded FCL method
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
▪	⒈	Get the list of concept-attribute pairs.
▪		∙	Read in the (Concept, Attribute) pairs
·		∙	Or read in a list of concepts, each containing a sublist of attributes
·		∙	Or read in a list of attributes, each containing a sublist of concepts
▪		While getting the list, set up the concept and attribute rosters.
▪	⒉	Lay out the Context matrix
▪		∙	Allocate an empty matrix of size based on the sizes of the respective rosters.
▪		∙	Run through the (Concept, Attribute) list and mark each item in the matrix
▪	⒊	Apply the FCA-synthesis algorithm to obtain the Galois-pairs
▪	⒋	Topologically sort the lattice
	⒌	Reorder the objects and attributes by affinity and factor-score them
	⒍	Minimize the concept-lattice
	⒎	Scan the list: for each attribute, mark the place where it first occurs.
		Reverse-scan the list: for each concept, mark the place where it last occurs.
		Scan the respective rosters and mark each entry by the corresponding attribute and/or concept.
	⒏	Display the results in topological order with:
		∙	Marked attributes
		∙	Marked concepts
		∙	Immediate precedessor entries
		∙	Immediate successor entries
	⒐	A second display mode is by
		∙	Concept roster/index (user-defined index base)
		∙	Attribute roster/index (user-defined index base)
		∙	For concept-attribute pairs: the concepts, attributes, (optionally): predecessors and successors.
